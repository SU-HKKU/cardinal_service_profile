# Hero Overlay

Within Layout builder, you can add new sections. When creating a section, you will be prompt to select a layout type. The Stanford One Column Overlay is the perfect layout to display a hero image and overlay text.

Along with the Stanford One Column Overlay section, we've created some custom utility classes.

## Inherited from Decanter/Core
**text-align-center** : horizontally centers text

## Custom utility classes
**su-hero-left** : This sets the overlay box to 500px and adds the transparent background.

**su-hero-height** : This ensures that the background image flexs to the overlayâ€™s height

**su-hero-nospace** : Removes the default spacing beneath the hero. This is applied on the hero overlay when there is a filter immediately after.

## Steps

1. From the authoring page bar, select Layout (this is normally located on the far right, inline with Edit option).
2. You will be redirect to the Layout page. On this page, click "Add Section".
3. A pop-up will appear on the right. Select "Stanford One Column Overlay".
4. Within the Extra Class text field, you can add the following classes `su-hero-left su-hero-height su-hero-nospace text-align-center`.
5. Select "Add section".
6. Save layout.
